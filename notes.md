- try and do nav around the site without a nav bar. trying to make it feel more like an app and a journey, than a website.

## Wishlist

- [ ] funny animation to use as default when waiting for album art to load?
- [ ] transitions and animations as you move pages?
- [ ] Audio player could probably be powered by AWS backend. API gateway (only param is podcast id) -> powered by S3/cloudfront for audio, and album art url. the image could probably exist in AWS too
