# Feature Documentation

## Multi Author support 
- Author component on post layout
- when viewing a single author, see all the posts they've done
- again, https://github.dev/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog is pretty helpful to see how this could be structured
- try have data fetching being done as close to author components as possible, or however feels most intuitive. whatever encapsulates the code best.
