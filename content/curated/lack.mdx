Since putting this site together, I gave Bop's Tops a few listens, as part of my efforts for the post [Curator: Bop](/curated/curator-bop)

Naturally, I bumped into old favourites, and one artist caught my attention for a discography dive. And also felt like this music deserved its own space, to share that deep dive.

# Where it supposedly started
August 2021

# Who is Lack?
Excerpt from spotify profile
> Manchester's Charlie Foy produces dubwise experimental bass music
> under the name Lack. On EPs such as 2021's Make It Circular, he
> shapes broken beat patterns and rolling ambient textures into kinetic
> yet spacious club constructions.
> Lack's music first saw release through Howes' Cong Burn label. He
> shared a split cassette with BFTT in 2017, then contributed tracks to
> several 12" EPs released by the label between 2018 and 2020. Lack's
> Satin EP, a trio of journey-like tracks partially written on long train
> rides, was issued by Blank Mind at the end of 2019. The same label
> also released the 2020 debut EP by Nature Unit, a dub techno group
> featuring Foy. Lack made his Livity Sound debut with the 2020 EP
> Inside, which was followed by 2021's Make It Circular, a mixture of
> broken dub techno and dubstep. ~ Paul Simpson, Rovi

# The stuff I found today blew my mind
In no particular order, just *goodness* (very old inside joke, quoting Callum describing a the dominant Mercedes F1 car getting all the clean air at the front of the pack, or as he said, **all the goodness** ðŸ˜‚)
