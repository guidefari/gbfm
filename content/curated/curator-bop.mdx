# Playlist: Bop's Tops
A playlist that's updated monthly, with his 10 favourite tracks of that month.

I put this playlist on shuffle for a few minutes, and here are some favourites. 

## Datasette
Some cross pollination here. Datasette is also one of my favourite curators, and surprise surprise, Bop listens to him too :)

### Sentiel
<Track url={'2SCGxkBzzBxVJxNU7bPovJ'} genres={['experimental', 'braindance']} blurb='Starting with the latest track in the playlst, title track from the EP Sentiel. Loved every single track in there. This track has a gooey sound to it, I dig it.'/>

### Sounds from Void Fill Product

<Track url={'7GqxBsJwQVjNf73T06VuZw'} genres={['experimental', 'gooey', 'braindance']}>
    <p>This album, and <a href='https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0IqnfXO3Eq02rPFYlERFWW?si=7ea30ccce0b0408b' target='_blank' >Bop's playlist</a>, were probably my introduction to Datasette, around August 2020.</p>

## The most 'experimental' I've heard Grad_U

<Track url={'30SFuvenjWg1LgEiV3PZVt'} genres={['experimental', 'dub']} />

## Sounds from Record Label, Astral Industries
<Track url={'5dzt8OCfq9yFL3ueehOoyY'} genres={['ambient']} blurb='This may have been my introduction to the label. Absolutely fell in love with their artwork'/>

<Album url={'0hnVSwbGkjHWmc741L0dlG'} genres={['dub', 'minimal']} blurb='While we are here, we might as well check out a Deepchord release that I like from the label.'/>

Check out [Astral Industries on Bandcamp](https://astralindustries.bandcamp.com/music), immerse yourself in the artwork a little.
