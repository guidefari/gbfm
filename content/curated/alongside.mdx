The idea behind this concept is simple. I imagine what Iâ€™d play at a gig if it were to be alongside the mentioned artist. 

Basically a way to practice. And I made a very cocky claim to TK, that I can play next to anyone ðŸ˜‚obviously with a little prep and incentive 

## Planned Alongsides & their accompanying playlists 

## FlyloFM Extended
Concept I recently started shaping. There's a certain style of sound that FlyLo exposed me to, 
and I sometimes wonder what an extended version of FlyLoFM could sound like.
