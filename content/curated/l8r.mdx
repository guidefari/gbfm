I've tried listening to my DJ mixes on the same day of recording, often within a few minutes or couple of hours

I've also tried listening back to mixes a few days after recording, and I tend to enjoy mixes more, the longer it is post recording.
The more time I give it, the less analytical I am, and I forget some things, so there's some surprises too, which is always fun.
