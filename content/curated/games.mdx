# Nostalgia & Music

Music can be a very powerful time capsule for feelings, emotions, state of mind and all the works.

At some point, I decided to embrace that experience, the trip down memory lane, the feeling of nostalgia.

A lot of my library today is influenced by trying to capture that feeling of nostalgia. Video games were a very big part of my life growing up, and I was introduced to a very wide array of music.

Soundtracks & curated music are a very important dimension of the gaming experience.

# Need for Speed Pro street

This song started randomly playing back in my head, & I knew straight away it was finally time to flesh out this post.

I have many fond memories of playing pro street, lots of them with my young brother. I'm sure I completed that game's career at least 5 times. I've always enjoyed NFS games that lean more on the sim racing than arcade side.

# Def Jam Vendetta

I remember thinking this game was so cool, because of 2 reasons:

* Strong Hip Hop culture
* Wrestling

# NFS Underground 2

# GTA V
