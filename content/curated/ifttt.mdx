Part of my curating process goes something like this👇

If this then that. The thinking behind this is, “If you like this `<track, album, artist or playlist>` then I might have other similar stuff you’ll enjoy”
And that means you get to explore more music that you could enjoy. That’s why I like to ask what you’re listening to.

It's also a method of programming DJ sets. You can go into a set with a theme such as:

- Deep house
- Ambient techno
- Music to fall asleep to

And so on. But even with a theme, there needs to be an element of variability in your tracklist.

See [inspo](/curated/inspo) for good examples of this.
