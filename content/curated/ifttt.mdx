Part of my curating process goes something like this👇

If this then that. The thinking behind this is, “If you like this `<track, album, artist or playlist>` then I might have other similar stuff you’ll enjoy”

### Wonder what this looks like
And that means you get to explore more music that you could enjoy. That’s why I like to ask what you’re listening to.
