# A little story

The one time while taking a drive with TK, we put the Zimbabwe heat playlist on shuffle, and by some black magic, it narrated the story of a feud between two artists we happen to enjoy very much in that playlist. 

This post is our best recreation of that tale. And some very hype tracks came with it, most of these are in my gym playlist :)
