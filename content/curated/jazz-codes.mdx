# Funny story

The story of how I found this album is interesting. Johannes shared an experimental track, and I found out it was from that [CERN](https://home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-mission). That immediately made me raise an eyebrow and dig in further, because [CERN](https://home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-mission) & anything to do with music was the last thing I'd have expected. So I was very curious. That alone, is worth its own post.

Anyway, after digging around the CERN stuff for a bit, the first name that stuck out was **Black Quantum Futurism** and I thought okay, let me sample some tunes on spotify.

The first song I came across was UMZANSI from this album, and I was hooked right away. I eventually made time to listen to the whole album, and boy, was I in for a treat.

## An Ode
I don't know why, but the phrase ‚Äúode to `{insert name here}`‚Äù carries so much weight to me. I always pay slightly more attention to a track named with such.

While we‚Äôre here, here‚Äôs another such track. And I love it

## Alternative Hip hop & Rap
Punchy, concise and tight sounds from WOODY SHAW. Amazing alternative hip hop tune, mellow beat with dope drums, and dreamy vocals. 
I‚Äôm yet to listen to the lyrics on this one, I still find myself focusing on the beat a lot more, even during active listening sessions.

You will bop your head to this

Another cool rap outro

## Interludes
A nice way to pace albums is to sprinkle little interludes. Everyone (me) loves a good interlude

In fact, a lot of tracks in this album can be used as an interlude in mixes of other genres. Very flexible sound, can be mixed into almost anything I‚Äôd play. While recording a mix yesterday, I played a few songs from this album.

## Random sidenote
There‚Äôs a bird that built a nest just outside my kitchen window, that nest is still green, few days old. 
It‚Äôs 6AM, I‚Äôm watching the bird doing bird things, while writing, the sound feels appropriate.

## A bit emo 
That closing verse is healing though, after a sad song üí™üèΩ

# Conclusion 
The whole album is worth a listen. Such a dreamy experience. If you like Atlanta and its afro surrealist thing, you‚Äôll dig this album.
