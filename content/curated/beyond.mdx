# Slices of experimental techno

- SND, clicks & cuts
- brainjazz, barcode & friends
- Arpeggios, Sam Barker, JakoJako

# My week in music

When I felt like a particular week had a story worth telling, I'd carry on with the weekly playlist format.
These even powered a few mixes along the way, and were always a low effort playlist to enjoy on shuffle, when I feel like hearing recent favourites.

  I listened to a fair amount of footwork throughout the year, but I'd say Adrian is responsible for
  launching me into somewhat of a deep dive into the genre. The final quarter of the year was
  footwork heavy - from 4AM sessions, to powering the workouts, this genre found itself fitting into
  many moments.

# 4AM energy

I often found myself working super early in the AMs, and there's some music that fit the scenery & mood of the time so well.
At some point, I started putting the songs together in a playlist, this was mostly curated & managed around 4AM of course.

# Goosebumps mixes

# WorldwideFM

- Blueish
- greentea peng

These drums are amazing. Grateful to have bumped into Church & Matt's music. They have some music on [bandcamp](https://health.bandcamp.com/album/neighbours) too.

# Friends, fellow curators

My library has grown as a team effort. Really appreciate these tunes that have been shared.

## Ajnkana releases

Ajnkana has had a solid year of releases, I've enjoyed tracks from every single one of them.
I've also played a bunch of them in my mixes this year, good times!

### Groove repeat - Gradual

### Pyroclastic Flow - another Cold Tear release

This track has a bit more of a playful feel, while exploring the Jamaican roots of dub techno.
