# Playlist: Bop's Tops
A playlist that's updated monthly, with his 10 favourite tracks of that month.

I put this playlist on shuffle for a few minutes, and here are some favourites. 

## Datasette
Some cross pollination here. Datasette is also one of my favourite curators, and surprise surprise, Bop listens to him too :)

### Sentiel
Starting with the latest track in the playlst, title track from the EP Sentiel. Loved every single track in there. This track has a gooey sound to it, I dig it.

### Sounds from Void Fill Product
This album, and Bop's playlist, were probably my introduction to Datasette, around August 2020.
