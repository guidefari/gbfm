# Playlist: Bop's Tops
A playlist that's updated monthly, with his 10 favourite tracks of that month.

I put this playlist on shuffle for a few minutes, and here are some favourites. 

## Datasette
Some cross pollination here. Datasette is also one of my favourite curators, and surprise surprise, Bop listens to him too :)

### Sentiel
Starting with the latest track in the playlst, title track from the EP Sentiel. Loved every single track in there. This track has a gooey sound to it, I dig it.

### Sounds from Void Fill Product
This album, and Bop's playlist, were probably my introduction to Datasette, around August 2020.

## The most 'experimental' I've heard Grad_U

<Track url={'30SFuvenjWg1LgEiV3PZVt'} genres={['experimental', 'dub']} />

## Sounds from Record Label, Astral Industries
This may have been my introduction to the label. Absolutely fell in love with their artwork

<Track url={'5dzt8OCfq9yFL3ueehOoyY'} genres={['ambient']} />

While we're here, we might as well check out a Deepchord release that I like from the label.

Check out [Astral Industries on Bandcamp](https://astralindustries.bandcamp.com/music), immerse yourself in the artwork a little.

## Ambient scapes from Nils Frahm
