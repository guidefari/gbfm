There's weeks where I find myself mostly repeating the music that's recently been added to my library.
I think this past week has been such, and it's been a while since I've done a "My week in music" type post.

## Thando Zide

These two tracks really set the tone of my week.

## Brian Leeds

This man is no stranger to my playlists. I've had two new releases on repeat,
the Loidis album which caters to the minimal and dub techno crowds, and
a remix under a new alias, Mosslander Tablet - solid ambient and dreamy vibes over there.

I played this in a [Skee Mask heavy mix](/mixes/gb52) just over a year ago🤯

Here's [a thread](https://x.com/guidefari/status/1820736857610563762) with the songs I had on repeat.

Hereby declaring August 6 as International Skee Mask day 🫡.
The mix was recorded on the 6th of August 2023,
and the thread was 6 Aug 2024 🤷🏽‍♂️.

## Shona Trap/Drill

Anyone that's had the pleasure of being my passenger knows I always have
these tunes playing loud in the car.
