# Clicks & Cuts
Not really dub techno, but an important sound for me. Some quotes from [the history of dub techno](/curated/dub-history)

> Clicks & cuts for instance, is a sound that started developing alongside of dub techno; eg Pole, & Vladislav Delay, who were directly related to Basic Channel as they'd worked together in the past.

Some of the earliest traces of dub techno can be attributed to Basic Channel around 1993, and their sound then, still has a large influence on how today's dub techno sounds.

Boomkat, a popular store - categorise **Basic Channel** as a genre.
