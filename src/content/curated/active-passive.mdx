- Active curation is when you sit down with the sole intention of getting your initial playlist done in one effort.
Tiago Forte refers to this execution mode as a big lift
- While passive is more, I know the general mood and theme I'm going for, I'll gather tracks that I like over the next few weeks 
of listening, and figure out the story as I go along. This is what Tiago Forte refers to as a slow burn
- I've been in passive curation mode for a while, it's only when I have gigs that I sit down and do active curation.
this is required mostly because for the last few years, any gigs have been hella short notice!

## tracklist order

Active curation also includes sorting out the order of the tracklist
to be fair you can also do this at the end of a passive curation effort.
But I usually bundle it as part of the process of active curation.
mostly depends on what the mix is for
