# A little story

The one time while taking a drive with TK, we put the Zimbabwe heat playlist on shuffle, and by some black magic, it narrated the story of a feud between two artists we happen to enjoy very much in that playlist. 

This post is our best recreation of that tale. And some very hype tracks came with it, most of these are in my gym playlist :)

## Zviri Pa 2
<Track url={'3gf31LRP1LH9D2KWuAc9Mm'} blurb='Apparently this is where the beef started'/>

## The story of Modhe
<Track url={'0yCJfJdysJ270jYZPVBax2'} blurb='Big big energy, there was no recovering from this, lol'/>

## Ko Makuitasei?
<Track url={'293SP4drPhfAiwZHssvXNZ'} genres={['drill']}>
    Shuffle reached into Holy Ten's archive to provide a worthy clapback, was a sweet switch up
</Track>

## Of course Bho Zvangu featured in the mix

## Murder with Probeatz
Probeatz aka Captain Mufombi delivered a killer verse for this track!

## Voltz says Don't forget
Mukomana atsamwa üò¨.
<Track url={'42sKpkibxojk4ilOGGmz2Z'} blurb='' genres={['drill']}/>

## Hopefully this bad blood is buried at some point though
The gents have collaborated before, and some good stuff came out of it.

As Skepta says
> I don't wanna war, lets make peace
>
> Good energies make the stacks increase
I agree with this sentiment.
