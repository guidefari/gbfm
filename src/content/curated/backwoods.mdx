# Intro
Johannes shared [one1one by Jack Jelfs feat. Jessica Barter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNcDM-3lbjI). Be warned, the video, vocals, and overall vibes are a trip. But dammit those drums are tight! 

While reading the video‚Äôs description, these words caught my eyes:
>  During their 2018 residency at CERN

This is a summary of how the project was put together
>  a garbled invocation of language data-sets, algorithmically generated text and frenzied machine poetry. Collaborator Jessica Barter reads words generated by an A.I. trained by Jelfs in a techno-shamanic ritual, leading an incantation that opens with the declaration: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre ordered to erase sounds‚Äù

I thought science and music, that ought to be interesting. And the word **residency** implied there was more where that came from, so naturally I went digging.  

> Loving these artists that really blend music and software creativity
> - me, 01 Aug 2022

These vibes made me think of Max Cooper, who‚Äôs collaborated with a wide array of talented creatives
- Max Cooper made me aware of [Xander Steenbrugge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkKx4Fn02iM&t=1s), who [created a video for Exotic Contents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G55lrhUIezk)
- [Max Cooper - Swapped \(Official video by Dimitri Thouzery\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRR1GWP9IT0) - I can barely watch this one because of flashing lights and all, but I love the art direction
- [Barker has done something similar for JakoJako](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81rpWqo8Si8).
- My instagram also has a few musicians that take their visuals seriously

I digress. Back to the main storyline

# Moor Mother
UMZANSI immediately stood out to me. Black Quantam Futurism won the 2021¬†[CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN)¬†Collide artist's residency, and that‚Äôs how I found Moor Mother. I spent MONTHS bingeing her music daily. Timeless music 

## ‚Ä¶feat Billy Woods ‚Ä¶feat ELUCID
After a few weeks of listening to her, I noticed a little trend. Anytime she had a track with either Billy Woods, or ELUCID, it was pretty much guaranteed I‚Äôd like the song.

Imagine my excitement when I found out Billy Woods has some Zimbabwean roots (his dad).
I finally put two and two together, and the album cover with Robert Mugabe immediately made sense.
It's at that point when I really started paying attention to Woods.

## Earl Sweatshirt
