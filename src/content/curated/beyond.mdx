I spent a lot of time chasing depth within my library. Deep diving on artists, [record labels](/labels), 'obscure' sub-genres. It has been lots of fun, and only the beginning of the journey

This is also the year I got really cozy with bandcamp, discogs, tidal, as well as reacquainting with soundcloud & mixcloud.

# 4AM energy

<Playlist url={'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0caDfB5MwbUQQgmWl3exT2?si=414e7d60b6194385'}>
  I often found myself working super early in the AMs, and there's some music that fit the scenery &
  mood of the time so well. At some point, I started putting the songs together in a playlist, this
  was mostly curated & managed around 4AM of course.

  I listened to a fair amount of footwork throughout the year, but I'd say Adrian is responsible for
  launching me into somewhat of a deep dive into the genre. The final quarter of the year was
  footwork heavy - from 4AM sessions, to powering the workouts, this genre found itself fitting into
  many moments.
</Playlist>

This Red Bull interview gives some good history on the footwork genre.

The Hoavi album was released by the label Peak Oil, home to Topdown Dialectic, whom I also really enjoyed listening to this year.
I'm definitely going to do a deep dive of their releases at some point in the future

These drums are amazing. Grateful to have bumped into Church & Matt's music. They have some music on [bandcamp](https://health.bandcamp.com/album/neighbours) too.

# DJ mixes

- [Goosebumps mixes](https://www.youtube.com/@goosebumpsfm/videos)
- [Blueish radio](https://worldwidefm.net/search?q=blueish) by [Puma Blue](https://www.mixcloud.com/pumablue/) constantly delivered quality. Very relaxed vibe, spanning across multiple genres. World-class curator, this gent.
- [music4programming](https://musicforprogramming.net/) by Datassette remains a refuge I adore. I enjoyed spending time on that site.
- [Soundcloud playlist with mixes](https://soundcloud.com/guidefari/sets/4l8r)

I had this one on repeat for quite a while. Was a very good mix for crate diggig, led me to quite a number of tracks that featured in my own mixes.

# Silence

I embraced it a bit more than in the past. I have [autoplay off](https://www.guidefari.com/autoplay-opinion/) on all my streaming apps, which resulted in me having lots of quiet moments.

Was weird at first, but I grew to enjoy it. This is a big step for someone who's used to having headphones on 90% of the time😄from a perpetual "won't do anything without music" to embracing silent moments felt serene.

# Hip Hop, Grime

There's a month or two when I had Ghetts on repeat almost every day!

# Friends, fellow curators

My library has grown as a team effort. Really appreciate these tunes that have been shared.

## [Ajnkana releases](/curated/ajnkana)

Ajnkana had a solid year of releases, I've enjoyed tracks from every single one of them.
I've also played a bunch of them in my mixes this year, good times!

The track above is what led me to [Jazz Codes](/curated/jazz-codes)!
