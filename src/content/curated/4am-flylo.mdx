# Playlist: [4AM energy](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0caDfB5MwbUQQgmWl3exT2?si=cc577bb6cfb44be8)

<Playlist url={'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0caDfB5MwbUQQgmWl3exT2?si=37ad82f390f44589'}>
  I only interact with with this playlist early morning. These tracks know how to set a mood.

# Artist: [Moor Mother](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4kANxfLenUobb7t5fHSrgA?si=pxtvx__ITDmJwlwsWeieEg)

I just can't stop listening to her work.
I started the day with this two track combo

<Track

  blurb="A bit emo 
That closing verse is healing though, after a sad song 💪🏽"
/>
<Track
  url={'6Ft2Uk7Y8GELALXtrcwl6G'}
  blurb="Thumper of a beat, choppy hip hop sounds. And solid verses!"
/>

# Playlist: [FlyLoFmExtended](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4NItiNFlA1wzj5dp7bRpFo?si=eb606037a1c64128)

That second track brings me to a concept I'm exploring.
[GTA V FlyloFM](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/FlyLo_FM) is a radio I enjoyed quite a bit. Heck, I downloaded GTA V for
the 6th playthrough, just so I can listen to the radio and mess around.

That got me thinking, what could an extended version of [FlyloFM](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/FlyLo_FM) sound like.

That's what [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4NItiNFlA1wzj5dp7bRpFo?si=eb606037a1c64128) is, exploring the sounds that fit alongside Flying Lotus.

The playlist will be a mix of some favourites from the original radio, and my extensions of course. Listening to it as I write this, and it's one melter after the other. Love it!
