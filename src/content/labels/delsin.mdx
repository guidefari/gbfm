# About Delsin
- Amsterdam based
- Founded by [Peel Seamus](https://www.discogs.com/artist/6307-Peel-Seamus) in 1996

## Yagya inspired this note
I decided to take note of the label while listening to some of his music.

Anytime I listen to one track from this album, a Yagya binge starts!
Easily one of my favourite all time dub-techno records.

## Entrypoint

I found this album, or this album found me, at a pivotal time.
It was when I was getting more intentional about digging for ambient leaning music,
and this was one of the first albums that made me feel like "this is a sound I expect to be in my life forever"

Right up there with the likes of Huerco S. & Datassette, in terms of how dear I hold the sound to me.
There's a healthy variety of sub-genres explored in here, some soundscapey feels, tension filled dub-influenced sounds,
techno, deep-lofi house, grunge & granular too.

Also a big fan of the album cover. It has a dystopian feel to it, and matches the sound pretty well.

The bass in this track has an ear-shattering feel to it. love it!

*ps: I had no idea this was a Delsin release until the time of writing this noteðŸ˜‚*


# Konduku
Konduku is a staple in my dub & bass playlist - meaning he sits at the 
intersection between dub techno, and bass music.

He quickly became a staple in most of my mixes.
I would recommend an exploration of [his entire discography](https://konduku.bandcamp.com/), it's filled with quality!

# Claro Intelecto
Two releases Claro that are timeless for me, [Forgotten Wasteland](https://clarointelecto.bandcamp.com/album/forgotten-wasteland-ep?label=2516297851&tab=music)
& [Exhilarator](https://clarointelecto.bandcamp.com/album/exhilarator?label=2516297851&tab=music)

He's another one who knows how to manipulate the feeling of tension in his music.
Dances around bass that sucks you into your headphones, paired with moments of relief.

<Album

I can say without a doubt, this was one of my favourite albums in 2019.
It has remained a staple in the playlists & mixes, timeless record for me.

> thick blanket of pads... there's a consistent heaviness... wields weighty sound matter with precision
