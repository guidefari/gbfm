# About Delsin
- Amsterdam based
- Founded by [Peel Seamus](https://www.discogs.com/artist/6307-Peel-Seamus) in 1996

## Yagya brought me here.
Anytime I listen to one track from this album, a Yagya binge starts!
Easily one of my favourite all time dub-techno records.

# Konduku
Konduku is a staple in my dub & bass playlist - meaning he sits at the 
intersection between dub techno, and bass music.

He quickly became a staple in most of my mixes.
I would recommend an exploration of his entire discography, it's filled with quality!
