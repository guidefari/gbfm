Starting with a spacey and atmospheric sound from the opening Burial song.

06:00 - a much quieter ambient track. Starting the **real**
intro to the mix. Meditative sound, inviting a moment to yourself.

10:00 - Gorgeous sound from Jagua here. Listened to the rest
of the EP for the first time while writing this.
*I can see POCKET DIAL growing on me!*

13:00 - I can't understand a word, but there's something
striking about the atmosphere in this track.
There's a happy energy that I fw.

14:30 - Not much to say here. Just a cool tune

17:30 - Classic deep house tune! I've had this one
in my playlists for years. And it's been
played on many mixes & radio shows over the years. What a tune

21:00 - A-Reece is a staple in the hip-hop
rotations. The intro to this track has beautiful
spoken word.

22:00 - Not to toot my own horn, but I really enjoy
how I mixed in the LOR track with A-Reece here.

24:55 - Major vibe change here. Hip hop interlude
I suspect Armand Hammer
will be on repeat for life. Time will tell.

I keep finding gems in their discography. Even after
months of daily playbacküôå

27:00 - Continues on the hip hop note with a banger
from Lord Folter, whom I had on repeat for a few months.
Found so many good productions in his discography. This is
the kind of sound I enjoy in slow late night drives...

29:20 - Barbarians, coming off the 2017 album, [Rome](https://www.discogs.com/master/1288557-Armand-Hammer-Rome)

33:00 - Speeding up the vibe with a trip to Japan, courtesy
of Skee Mask!

# Ran out of steam!
LOL, I tried to add timestamp comments, while making sure
the tracklist was in play order. and paused halfway.
Life got in the way etc etc, and I just ran out of steam for the rest
of this task. 

This is getting in the way of publishing. which I don't like
So I decided to just ship it as is.

Enjoy!
