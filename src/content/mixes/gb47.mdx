*This mix was originally published on [his
Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/seven74/space-electronics) - do check it out
for more mixes!*

Fun fact: Difuz and I spent a few months sharing and chatting about Electro.
This conversation started when we discovered our mutual love for
[2845 by Convextion](https://mojubarecords.bandcamp.com/album/2845) !

This mix is for the Detroit Techno, and electro lovers
Less than 10 minutes in, the sounds had me dancing, and the selection remained
quality right through to the end!
It's a good blend of high energy, and calm moments of recovery.

Lest we forget a [recent release he was a part
of](https://abstractrhythm.bandcamp.com/track/oxytocin-with-difuz) from
[Abstract Rhythm](https://www.instagram.com/abstractrhythm/).
An absolute banger🙌

## Mini Q&A

Q: How did yout put this mix together?
> I always dig for new music. Whether in record stores for vinyl or on bandcamp and other online platforms for digital formats. This mix was played on two CDJ's and a mixer.

Q: 5 noteworthy sources of inspiration from the 90s for you? open format, any genre.
> Hard to pick 5 out. I have been influenced by a huge variety of music, artists, labels from the 70s until today. To pick 5 sources who also had releases in the 90s I would go with Drexciya, Gerard Hanson, Basic Channel, Move D (and his Source Records label), MF Doom
