This mix was originally published on [his Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/seven74/space-electronics) - do check it out for more mixes!

Less than 10 minutes in, this mix had me dancing. 
It's a good blend of high energy, and calm moments of recovery.

The tracklist is well selected tunes throughout.

## Mini Q&A

Q: How did yout put this mix together?
> I always dig for new music. Whether in record stores for vinyl or on bandcamp and other online platforms for digital formats. This mix was played on two CDJ's and a mixer.

Q: 5 noteworthy sources of inspiration from the 90s for you? open format, any genre.
> Hard to pick 5 out. I have been influenced by a huge variety of music, artists, labels from the 70s until today. To pick 5 sources who also had releases in the 90s I would go with Drexciya, Gerard Hanson, Basic Channel, Move D (and his Source Records label), MF Doom
