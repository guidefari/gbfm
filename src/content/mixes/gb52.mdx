- Some ambient Skee Mask (SCNTST) about 5 minutes in (SCNTST	300 AD Part II) - Love that track!
- Oalyman put me onto datassette	Flechte - shout out 🍻 Anything Datassette touches is gold
- Segue	Stepping Up starts 16 minutes in. Timeless ambient dub techno tune, it's been a no skip track since the day I found it!
- 23 minutes in - I enjoyed the transition from Brothomstates	Mdrmx, into	Konx-om-Pax	Rez (Skee Mask Remix)
- ~27 minutes in  Personne Aliénée	Oxytocin (with [Difuz](/mixes/gb47)) is such a high energy track, another no skip
- The Waleed track ~32 minutes in is another plug from Oalyman
- ~33min in, the transition into MPU101	SYS1FinMwitch felt well timed. good shift of energy
- 37min - Skee Mask	Japan Air
- 50 minutes in - I like the shift of energy into ambient here after a few B2B bass punches. little breather. before more bass ofc😂
