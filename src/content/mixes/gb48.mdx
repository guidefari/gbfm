Slow start with some ambient favourites. 
I especially dig the Slow Attack Ensemble track, their albums are [no skips](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20skip%20album)

I binged Space Afrika for a few weeks, lol. [KRMU](https://kmru.info/) introduced me to Space Afrika in a mix he did for BBC.

The [Billy Woods](https://backwoodzstudioz.com/pages/billy-woods) tracks are coming from his latest album, [Maps](https://billywoods.bandcamp.com/album/maps). He has a dense & very impressive discography. I've been on a binge for a few months now!
Both Woods' tracks in this mix feature [E L U C I D](https://backwoodzstudioz.com/pages/elucid), making it [Armand Hammer](https://backwoodzstudioz.com/pages/armand-hammer)

The Max Cooper Track represents a sub-genre of techno I love, [textured](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1yQ7fmfaWujhoZrEzozuA1?si=8ec286725ef6408b) sounds!

I had quite a dance when that Laurel Halo x Skee Mask section came onü§åüèæ I cannot express how much I love Skee Mask's music
