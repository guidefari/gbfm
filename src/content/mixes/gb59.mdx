The idea behind this one is multi-layered, arpeggio heavy tunes. I wanna say Huerco S is the one that introduced me to the style.

Some timeless favourites of mine are in this style:
- Huerco S album
- Jan Jelinek
- Beatrice Dillon
- Sam Barker
- Latest entry: Alexander Wallin. I think this was shared by Sam before a gig, I've enjoyed this one ever since
