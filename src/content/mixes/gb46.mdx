- Dreamy start to the mix, opening with ambient cuts from Shipwreck Detective, Aphex Twin, & the new King Krule!
- Hip hop sounds are opened by billy woods this week. I've had him on repeat in lots of playlists for the last few months
- The closing track is coming from one of my [top albums in 2022](/curated/beyond) - Xyla gave us such a solid album there, massive respect
