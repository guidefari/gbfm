Now, I haven't listened to the whole thing, but I know Electrosoul & Dissident are heavy hitters from my days of listening to lots of Hospital Records.
This is def worth checking out

Dub Phizix has been a staple in my dnb lib since early days!

I listened to the first track of this album blind, I'd queued a whole bunch of stuff
And I remember feeling "yoo, fans of Skee Mask would love these drums"
Only to see his name in the credits

Anyway, this album is literally banger after banger

Text Chunk recently had me dancing a lot via the album with Hood Joplin.
Been jamming this one for like a year now. Solid vibes too
