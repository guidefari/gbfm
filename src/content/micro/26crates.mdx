### Weekend crates
- [goosebumps mix #47](/mixes/gb47) tracklist is up. Some very nice releases in there. Electro, Detroit Techno, Acid, all round good vibes.
  Big shouts to Svenio for sharing these! So far, I've listened to [Relpek by Infiltrate](https://infiltraterec.bandcamp.com/album/relpek) & [Habibi Bass by Cyan85 vs Turk Turkelton](https://lunarorbiterprogram.bandcamp.com/album/habibi-bass)
- dgoHn is releasing an EP soon. Naturally I listened to [the one song that
  ￼s out](https://dgohn-music.bandcamp.com/track/not-just-a-best), and also checked out the album [Undesignated Proximate by dgoHn](https://dgohn-music.bandcamp.com/album/undesignated-proximate)
  - Skee Mask is the one who brought dgoHn to my attention with [this remix](https://dgohn-music.bandcamp.com/track/robins-windmill-skee-mask-remix).
- [Barker’s Unfixed](https://sambarker.bandcamp.com/album/unfixed) is out! This dude is one of my favourite percussionists and all-round producers. This release is no exception, stellar work as always. Gave me a fun start to the day yesterday. Golden Hammer is my stuff!
- [Popottam](https://calabasamusic.bandcamp.com/track/popottam) by [Calabasa](https://calabasamusic.bandcamp.com/) - fun dance (house) tune
- I listened to [Kompakt's Pop Ambient 2001](https://kompakt.bandcamp.com/album/pop-ambient-2001) and enjoyed the bulk of it.
