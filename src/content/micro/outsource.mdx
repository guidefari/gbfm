Scale your efforts as a music curator. In practice, that means listening to other curator's playlists. 

You can't listen to all the music by yourself, and a lot of the time, when exploring a new sound, it is very likely that someone else can deliver a much tidier *'best of'* than you could by yourself.

I've found music that I've adored for years, from other curators, and continue to find lots of dope shit that way.
