While reflecting on my year in music (2022), I made this comment about Footwork

The genre remains dear to me, and today I've decided to give it some more real estate on my little corner of the internet ðŸ˜„
It deserves more attention.

My main/first footwork playlist has grown into a decent 5Â½hr playback time,
with some highlights from the genre over ~(the last year)

As per the playlist description on Spotify, weâ€™ll talk about neighbouring sub-genres too. Following my IFTTT format

- quite a number of entries from Livity
- RP-Boo makes some really good sound! Pay attention, everytime you see his name.
- RIP DJ Rashad. GTA Vâ€™s Flylofm had its wack in the track list. my true entrypoint into footwork, I had no idea what it was at the time, but knew I loved the heck out of the sound. DJ Rashad was one of the producers of that track.
- entries from Xyla are coming from what was one of my favourite albums of 2022!
- Skee Mask put me onto [Driven By Attraction](https://drivenbyattraction.bandcamp.com/music). heâ€™s got some really good releases
- K Wata is the shizzle

Thatâ€™s all the words I have for todayâ€¦ till next time
