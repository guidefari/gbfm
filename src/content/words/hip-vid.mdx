I don't watch music videos all that much, but can appreciate well put together
visuals when I come across them.

This post shares a few highlights

# [Ryosuke Tanzawa](https://ryosuketanzawa.work/)

What I've most enjoyed about Ryosuke's videos is attention to detail.
There's little things I always catch while watching his videos and think 'damn, I can see some thought was put into this for sure'

Color palettes, frame cuts & transitions, how he places subjects. So many little details to nerd over.
[His IG](https://www.instagram.com/ryosuketanzawa/) is also worth a gander. Beautiful stills on there.

I like how Earl & Navy trade bars here 👇🏾. The frame cuts complement it really well!

## Directed by Joseph
I watched a bunch of videos by Backwoodz studios and a decent amount of them have this in the credits:
> Directed By Joseph

After enjoying them a bunch of their videos, I had to know who Joseph is.
And that sent me down a bit of a rabbithole of music videos of ELUCID & Billy Woods videos.
