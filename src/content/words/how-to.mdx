## Type of stuff I share
- Tracks
- Albums
- Playlists
- Artists
- DJ Mixes
- Record labels

Sometimes they're embedded as components I've built, or iframes from around the web, sometimes it's just a link.
I encourage you to interact with them, immerse yourself in the sound as you read.

# Preview Tracks
- Click on the album cover to get a 30 sec preview of the track.
- Can click on it to pause, or click another album cover to preview that one.
- There's also a play/pause button somewhere on the screen.
<Track url={'https://open.spotify.com/track/1paOXtSfaeFcZfzt9msquZ?si=a828fd51e80549ed'} genres={['deep', 'bass']} />

- Track title is a link to the full track on the streaming service.
- You can move around the site with a track preview playing.
Your listening experience won't be interrupted

# Playlists
<Playlist url={'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4LkfRKywcjlVpnzjcl9f6x?si=452aacec69064a6c'} genres={['ambient', 'dub']} />
- The idea is simple, preview track on the left, tracklist on the right.
- Click on a track on the tracklist to load it to the player on the left.
    - Now you can preview that track as you normally would a single track, by clicking the album cover.
- Built using the Single track component

# Preview Album
<Album url={'https://open.spotify.com/album/0Uvbi4PGR5p4uuHBvr5CIf?si=2f7db9da4a1f4d95'} genres={['experimental']} />
- Preview audio will be a random track from the album
- Planning to give this the same browsing experience as the playlist

# Now playing
- Scroll to the bottom of the site to see what I'm playing on spotify right now.
- I also have a [dedicated app](https://spotify.guidefari.com) for this
- If you catch me listening to weird shit, it's for research of course ;)
