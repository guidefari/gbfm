              A shower thought occured to me. Over time, this project has acted as a vehicle to
              archive music that me & friends are enjoying.

              A lot of stuff will be WIP. I sometimes publish pre first draft, because I've found
              immense value in early feedback from readers & listeners. A way you can help is by
              filling in a gap you see.

              One of the earliest forms of collaboration for this project was guest mixes. I still
              enjoy getting involved in these and will be more than happy to take in more
              submissions.
