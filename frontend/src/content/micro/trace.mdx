i’m listening to this track in the car. now, this radio is connected to bluetooth via [modulator](https://www.amazon.com/bluetooth-fm-modulator/s?k=bluetooth+fm+modulator), and this particular modulator gives this particular shower sound, and it’s loudness is directly proportional to the radio’s volume level. basically, the higher your volume knob is, the louder that shower sound is.

now, in this moment, it’s a cold morning, but i have the windows down, and heater cranked on almost to the max, so you can hear it consistently working that heat into the sound. this is source two of background noises.

the sound/timbre of the heater is being modulated by the sound from this track. mind bending experience, very lovely feeling, totally unique listening experience.
