/**
 * Creates the account's Secrets Store and every secret in it.
 *
 * Cloudflare allows one store per account, so names are stage-scoped to keep
 * prod and staging from overwriting each other.
 *
 * `alchemy dev` runs Workers under local Miniflare, which rejects
 * `secrets_store_secret` bindings outright (unsupported in local mode).
 * Local dev therefore skips the Secrets Store entirely and binds each value
 * as `secret_text` instead — a plain `Redacted<string>`, sourced from the
 * deployment config. The Worker-side reader
 * (`resolveSecretBindings`) already falls back to treating a non-store
 * binding as the resolved string, so no runtime code needed to change.
