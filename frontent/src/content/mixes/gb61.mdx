The [new Skee Mask release](https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/itlp19-resort) had me in such a good mood, I felt the need to be immersed 
in music for a few more hours, thus this mix happened.

# Tracklist
ooph. Rekordbox didn't capture the tracklist for this one. Gonna have to write it by hand.

- 00:00 - [shipwreck detective - i](https://shipwreckdetective.bandcamp.com/album/rest). 
this guy and [kwajbasket](https://kwajbasket.bandcamp.com/album/6-deep-breaths) were the beginning of my bandcamp crate digging.
- 03:57 - [Skee Mask - thnk u](https://skeemask.bandcamp.com/track/thnk-u). fun fact, I ended my last mix with this track üòå.
[the whole album](https://skeemask.bandcamp.com/album/c) is great, recommended listen. 

While transcribing the tracklist, I paused to listen to [more kwajbasket](https://kwajbasket.bandcamp.com/album/memories-of-yangon). unreal nostalgiaü•≤

- 07:00 - [Skee Mask - Session Add](https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/track/session-add)
- 10:37 - [T++ - Anyi](https://honestjonsrecords.bandcamp.com/track/anyi) - Shout out [Dub Monitor](https://www.youtube.com/@DubMonitor) for the plug to this one.
- 15:10 - [Suzanne Kraft - Bank](https://suzannekraft.bandcamp.com/track/bank)
- 18:15 - [Skee Mask - Bassline Dub](https://skeemask.bandcamp.com/track/bassline-dub) - puts a smile on my face everytime. lush pads, punchy drum introüôåüèΩ
- 22:00 - [Skee Mask - mWidit (Edit)](https://skeemask.bandcamp.com/track/mwidit-edit)
- 24:40 - [Skee Mask - P.Prog](https://skeemask.bandcamp.com/track/p-prog) - I've played this in another mix before. Just can't remember which
- 28:20 - [Harry Griffiths - lid on lid off](https://harrygriffiths.bandcamp.com/track/lid-on-lid-off) - bit of an interlude moment here. I fw it.
- 30:00 - [datassette - When I'm Gone (w/ M‚Äã√º‚Äãcha)](https://datassette.bandcamp.com/track/when-im-gone-w-m-cha) - Digging into more modern classics. Sounds of my dreams. Another big dose of nostalgia with this one.
That phat bass is akin to the energy in [Skee Mask's 0607](https://skeemask.bandcamp.com/track/0607), lol.
- 32:55 - [Burial - Prayer](https://burial.bandcamp.com/track/prayer) - You know the drill, More modern classics, more nostalgia
- 35:35 - [Barker - Polytely](https://sambarker.bandcamp.com/track/polytely) - Polyrhythmic, metallic timbres. I've got a mix or two dedicated to these sounds.
Essential listening for me.
