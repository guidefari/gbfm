## Agent skills

### Pull requests

Use the `pr-description` skill when creating or updating PR descriptions. For UI changes verified in a browser, use the `pr-screenshot-evidence` skill to embed real screenshots in a `Test evidence` section of the PR description. Keep screenshots out of git and use disposable fixtures without real user data or secrets.
